Displays a welcome message using the rich.console module, providing instructions to the users.
Prompts the users to press ENTER to continue.
Sets up an empty list reg to store the registration details of users.
Starts an infinite loop for the registration process.
Asks the user to input their name and converts it to uppercase.
If the user enters 'q' (case-insensitive), it prints a message and continues to the next iteration, effectively restarting the registration process.
Checks if the input name contains only letters (no spaces) and provides an error message if it doesn't. The loop continues without storing the invalid input.
Asks the user to input their gamer tag.
If the user enters 'q' (case-insensitive), it prints a message and continues to the next iteration, effectively restarting the registration process.
Creates a dictionary registration with the user's name and gamer tag.
Appends the registration dictionary to the reg list.
Checks if the length of the reg list is at least 2 to determine if the registration process is complete. If it is, the loop breaks and moves on.
Displays a completion message for the registration process.
Iterates over the reg list and prints the registered names and gamer tags using the rich.console module.
Initializes the edit variable as None.
Iterates over the reg list to find a desired registration based on specific conditions (name equals 'WRONGN' or gamer tag equals 'WRONGGT').
If a matching registration is found, the edit variable is updated with the corresponding registration dictionary.
If the edit variable is not None, it performs necessary edits on the registration dictionary based on specific conditions (name equals 'WRONGN' or gamer tag equals 'WRONGGT').
Prints a success message if a registration was updated or a message indicating that the registration was not found.
The code does not include the code to validate whether a name or gamer tag already exists to avoid duplicate registrations, as mentioned in the last comment.
Overall, the code handles user registration, displays the registered names and gamer tags, and allows for editing specific registrations based on certain conditions.
